A Mod for Friday Night Funkin'
 
Easiest mod GREAT for beginners. I would TOTALLY recommend this mod as your first shot at the game.

This mod is closed source for now, but I have intentions to publish the code latr down the line. 
I do not take credit for the Kade Engine as it was made by KadeDeveloppers.
Most importantly, I have fun!!!!
